 <h1>The Simple Enjoyment of Dogs</h1>
<p class="fancy">I personally am a dog person. I throughly enjoy how they live their lives, pure and without thought to hurt another thing with malicious intent. 
  Their faces, adorable. Their personalities, unique. I get joy from every every dog I see. I currenlty have a papillon mixed breed. Possibly with a chihuahua but
  we are unsure, as she is a rescue. She is the sweetest and just loves every person she meets. She has grown my apprection for dogs
  throughout the eight years I have been blessed to have her as my ever loving companion. Dogs are simple and joyful creatures that I have much admiration for.</p>
